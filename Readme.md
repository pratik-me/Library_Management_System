# Backend
1. module vs commonjs
+ ES modules are used more than CommonJS because they are the modern JavaScript standard, offering benefits like asynchronous loading, static analysis for better performance, and native browser support.
## Middlewares
1. cors : To let frontend access our backend server.
    1. origin : An array containing all urls that can access our server.
    2. methods : An array defining requests that the urls can make with the server.
    3. credentials : A boolean value that tells the browser that the server allows credentials (such as cookies, HTTP authentication, or client-side SSL certificates) to be sent with cross-origin requests.
2. cookie-parser : For managing cookies
3. express.json AND express.urlencoded : For getting values as string not as JSON format.
